.. note::
   Depending on the server/client setting, user can sign up by themselves
   through email verification, which requires connection to AWS with paid
   account. For most on-premise installation, this feature is disabled by
   default.

   endpoint is temporarily restricted for security reasons.
   
   If the access is restricted due to the reasons above, please contact your system administrator.
