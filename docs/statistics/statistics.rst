On the Statistics page, you can check simple statistics related to the use of
compute sessions via a graph. You can select the usage period for the last day
or week from the range selection menu on the upper left. Items that can be
inquired are as follows.

* Sessions: The number of compute sessions created.
* CPU: The number of CPU cores allocated while the compute session was created.
* Memory: The amount of memory allocated while the compute session was created.
* GPU: The number of GPU units allocated while the compute session was created.
  If the Fractional GPU feature is enabled, it may not match the physics GPU.

Note that only the statistics of terminated sessions will be displayed here.
Also, week period may not be selectable by a user whose account is created not
longer than a week.
