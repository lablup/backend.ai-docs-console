============
Installation
============

The GUI console can be used in two forms. It can be used as a web service by
connecting to a separate web address prepared by the admins, or as an
app provided as a stand-alone executable file that does not require separate
installation. In the case of an app, depending on the security setting of the
desktop OS, it may be recognized as an unsigned executable file
and a permission check may be required.
